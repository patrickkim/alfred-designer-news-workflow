Designer News Workflow for Alfred 2
=============================
Ported [Hacker News Workflow](http://github.com/loris/alfred-hackernews-workflow) for [Designer News](http://news.layervault.com)

Opening a new chrome window, typing in "http://news.layervault.com" can be drag on "productivity". Alfred workflow makes it fast!

###Notes:
Would be nice if the request to DN was cached on a different server with timed refreshing instead of direct hits to DN. Might look into this later.
